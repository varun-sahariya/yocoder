                   <h2> KEEP INDENTATION CONSISTENT</h2>
                   It is very important to pick an indentation style and stick with it throughout programming. There are multiple established approaches to indentation style, but the style a software developer chooses is not what matters. What truly matters is that the indentation style chosen is consistent.

Consistent indentation practices produce coding that is easier to navigate through and allows developers to quickly address issues. If a software developer contributes to a project that has already established an indentation style, the best practice is to continue following that style.

                   <h2>CLEAR COMMENTING & DOCUMENTATION</h2>
                   Thankfully, in the last 5 years, Integrated Development Environments have improved greatly. IDEs make it extremely easy to comment in the coding a software developer is creating. Comments help other software developers clarify what functions are meant to do within the coding which is extremely helpful in open source coding efforts or group efforts to develop software. There are many IDE options out there for software developers to choose from and there are also many tools used for commenting.

While commenting can be helpful in coding, it is important to avoid obvious comments that could risk unnecessarily cluttering the backend of hte software.

                   <h2> AVOID DEEP NESTING TECHNIQUES</h2>
                   Nesting code through tabbing can help to organize lines of coding, but deep nesting often makes code harder to read instead of easier. Deep nesting is the practice of using multiple tabs to organize lines of coding, but is often more confusing than clarifying. By reducing the amount of tabs in coding, software developers improve readability. This, in turn, allows coders to easily access and navigate code in a situation where an error needs to be fixed or a change needs to be made.
                </p>
                <p>
                      <h2>LIMIT LINE LENGTH</h2>
                      Like consistent indentation and avoidance of deep nesting, limiting the line length of coding can greatly improve readability. A great example of properly execute line length limitations can be found in newspapers. The human eye can more easily read tall, narrow columns of text instead of long, horizontal lines. A good practice is to apply this same methodology to coding, so the programming language is easy to read.

                   <h2>ORGANIZE FOLDERS & FILES</h2>
                   If a software developer wanted to, they could write an entire program in one folder; however, it would be a nightmare to navigate and keep up. The best practice is to use a framework or create a system based off of an existing folder and file structure. With an organized set of folders and files, maintenance and management of a software developer’s program will be much easier. An organized folder and file system will also be beneficial to other software developers who may join the project.

                    <h2>COMPLETE CODE REFACTORING</h2>
                    “Refactoring” is a technological term for “cleaning up” and every software developer should practice refactoring code. The main goal of refactoring is not to fix bugs or add functionality. Instead, refactoring improves the readability, cleanliness, and quality of the recently developed code. The best time to refactor code is the day after it’s been written. This way the coding is still fresh and familiar to the software developer. After refactoring, it will be much more readable and reusable months later. A common saying in the world of software developers is “refactor early, refactor often”.
